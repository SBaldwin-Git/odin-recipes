    <p>
        A Greek favorite that makes everyone think you are a master chef and is sooo easy to make!!
        I taught a Greek friend how to make apple pie and she taught me this fabulous recipe.
        The phyllo dough for this recipe is found in the freezer section of most grocery stores.
        Add a little lemon zest to the sugar sauce, if desired

        Baklava  is a layered pastry dessert made of filo pastry, filled with chopped nuts, and sweetened with syrup or honey. It was one of the most popular sweet pastries of Ottoman cuisine.
        The pre-Ottoman origin of the dish is unknown, but, in modern times, it is a common dessert of Iranian, Turkish and Arab cuisines, and other countries of the Levant and Maghreb, along with the South Caucasus, Balkans, and Central Asia.

        Baklava is normally prepared in large pans. Many layers of filo dough, separated with melted butter and vegetable oil, are laid in the pan. A layer of chopped nuts—typically walnuts or pistachios, but hazelnuts are also sometimes used—is placed on top, then more layers of filo. Most recipes have multiple layers of filo and nuts, though some have only top and bottom pastry.

        Before baking (180 °C, 356 °F, 30 minutes), the dough is cut into regular pieces, often parallelograms (lozenge-shaped), triangles, diamonds or rectangles. After baking, a syrup, which may include honey, rosewater, or orange flower water is poured over the cooked baklava and allowed to soak in.
        
        Baklava is usually served at room temperature, and is often garnished with ground nuts.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>100 g walnuts</li>
        <li>100 g almonds</li>
        <li>100 g pistachios</li>
        <li>2 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp ground cloves</li>
        <li>200 g butter</li>
        <li>2 X 270g packets (12 sheets) of filo pastry</li>
        <li>300 g sugar</li>
        <li>100 ml Greek honey</li>
        <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>2 strips of orange zest</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4. Place all the syrup ingredients in a medium saucepan with 300ml of water and bring to a gentle simmer. Let it bubble away, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes or until the liquid has reduced by a third. Leave to cool. (The syrup must be cool when it is poured over the pastry otherwise the pastry will go soggy.)</li>
        <li>Blitz the nuts in a food processor until coarse, then tip into a bowl and stir through the cinnamon and cloves.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter, using a little of it to lightly grease a 40 x 25cm shallow tin with a pastry brush. Gently unfold the filo and cover with a damp tea towel to stop it cracking.</li>
        <li>Layer sheets of filo in the tin and brush each layer with melted butter. After 4 layers, scatter over half the nut mixture; repeat with 4 layers of filo, then the rest of the nuts. Top with the last 4 layers of filo, then generously butter the top. Cut into diamonds with a sharp knife – ensure the blade goes right to the bottom.</li>
        <li>Bake on the middle shelf of the oven on a hot baking sheet for 30–35 minutes, or until golden brown and crisp, reducing the temperature to 170ºC/325ºF/gas 3 if the baklava looks as though it is browning too quickly.</li>
        <li>Remove the baklava from the oven and spoon half the cooled syrup over the top. Leave for 5 minutes, then spoon over the remaining syrup. Allow the baklava to cool before removing the individual pieces from the dish with a palette knife.
